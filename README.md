# Project-Porftolio
A collection of in and out of class projects

This github repo holds a few of the coding projects I have completed in the past year. Two projects are completed in C, one in MIPS, and one using python for data science. Each folder has a description to give more detail about each project within them. Moreover, I have included a brief video that showcases a website I have been building using the Webflow application for a company (the file size is 62 MB so you have to download it to view). As I have not received all data yet, the homepage remains unfinished.

In addition to these uploaded projects, I am currently a undergraduate teaching assistant for Duke University's data structures and algorithms course which is taught in Java. Java is my strongest language, and I have completed multiple projects within this class. However, they are difficult to navigate and some of the code is written by the course administrators, so I decided not to include them.

Please let me know if you have any questions. My email is john.morgan@duke.edu
