# Project-Porftolio
A collection of in and out of class projects

This github repo holds a few of the coding projects I have completed in the past year. Two projects are completed in C, one in MIPS, and one using python for data science. Each folder has a description to give more detail about each project within them. Moreover, I have included a brief video that showcases a website I have been building using the Webflow application for a company (the file size is 62 MB so you have to download it to view). As I have not received all data yet, the homepage remains unfinished.
Please let me know if you have any questions. My email is john.morgan@duke.edu
