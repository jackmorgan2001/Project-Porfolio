# Project-Porftolio
A collection of in and out of class projects

This github repo holds a few of the coding projects I have completed in the past year. Two projects are completed in C, one in MIPS, and one using python for data science. Each folder has a description to give more detail about each project within them. Moreover, I have included a brief video that showcases a website I have been building using the Webflow application for a company as a web developer for 23Cubed (the file size is 62 MB so you have to download it to view). As I have not received all data yet, the homepage remains unfinished.

In addition to these uploaded projects, I am currently a undergraduate teaching assistant for Duke University's data structures and algorithms course which is taught in Java. Java is my strongest language, and I have completed multiple projects within this class. However, they are difficult to navigate and some of the code is written by the course administrators, so I decided not to include them (I included one problem I solved to show some java code).

Finally, I have also completed an internship at Amazon Robotics in high school where my main project was to redesign an internal tool management website in order to expedite the testing process of my team members. I used raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and calls to APIs to combine previous virtual tools, create a tool search page, and make the website far more appealing. As a member of the software quality assurance team, my project helped to make the lives of my team members easier. I no longer have code for this website due to company/confidentiality reasons.

Please let me know if you have any questions. My email is john.morgan@duke.edu
